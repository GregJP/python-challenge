# python-challenge

This is a homework assignment for the UNC Data Science Boot Camp that integrates the usage of reading CSV files and the data within them. In this assignment, I retrieved some important data values from a simple bank statement for a fictional company in which all of the values were determined by using loops and functions within the dataset. That can be found in the PyBank folder. In the PyPoll folder, I used a loop to count the total amount of votes in a CSV file to determine the perecentage of votes each candidate received while also determining the winner of the election. In both of the codes, I had the text written out to a text file in the analysis folder.
